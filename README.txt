1. For 'Simulation' file:
One layer and Multiple layers filters.ipynb: simulate our algorithms with one layer and multiple layers filter.
Optimization and VWA filter(1).ipynb: simulate our algorithms with optimizers and VWA filter in different related variables.
Optimization and VWA filter(2).ipynb: simulate our algorithms with optimizers and VWA filter in different network structures and distributions.
Prediction.ipynb: use fitered results to predict the dependent variable.


2. For 'Application' file:
One layer and Multiple layers filters.ipynb: use one layer filter, multiple layers filter to select the related variables of breast-cancer.
Optimization and VWA filter.ipynb: use optimizers and VWA filter to select the related variables of breast-cancer.
Prediction.ipynb: use the screened results to predict the breast-cancer.
Variations Distribution.ipynb: visualize the selected variations to find the explanation of the result.

3. For 'Other model' file:
Here we use deepPINK, deepLINK, Linear model-knockoff to fiter varibles, use the selected results to compare with the results filtered by our algorithms.
